This project predicts sales using historical data with the linear regression model. It includes data cleaning, feature engineering, model evaluation, and visualization.

📌 Key Steps in This Project:
✔ Data Cleaning – Removing duplicates, handling missing values, and normalizing columns.

✔ Feature Engineering – Creating revenue, log sales, profit margin, and seasonal trends.
✔ Model Training – Using Scikit-Learn's Linear Regression for prediction.
✔ Evaluation Metrics – Assessing model accuracy with RMSE & R².
✔ Visualization – Plotting actual vs predicted sales to gain business insights.

Sales – Target variable to predict 📈
Profit – Profit earned per order 💰
Discount – Discounts applied to sales 🏷️
Quantity – Number of items sold 🛒
Order Date – When the order was placed 📅
